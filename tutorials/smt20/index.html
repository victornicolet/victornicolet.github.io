							This short tutorial is an introduction on using Z3 as a SMT solver, and also techniques to
							encode problems into SMT problems. We will briefly review two theories that can be used with
							Z3: Linear Integer Arithmetic (LIA) and uninterpreted functions. To illustrate a problem
							that can be solved using LIA, we will look at the Job Shop problem. Then, we will solve a
							small logic problem to illustrate how functions can be used to model a seating arrangment.
						</p>
						<p>
							As in the previous tutorial, the interface to the solver is minimal and you should be able
							to
							memorize the few functions needed. The difficulty is to design the encoding of the problem,
							that is, the set of formulas or constraints that act as a definition of the problem.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can find a guide to the API <a
								href="https://ericpony.github.io/z3py-tutorial/guide-examples.htm"> here</a>. However,
							in this tutorial we are only using a very restricted subset of the commands. In particular
							we are only using integer, boolean and function literals.
						</p>
						<p>
							You should already have installed Z3 and its python API in order to complete Assignment 3
							and
							the tutorial on SAT solving. If not, head to the <a href="../sat20/index.html">the first
								tutorial</a> and follow the short installation guide.

							Before watching the video, you should download the starter code for the Job Shop problem
							example
							<a href="job_shop.zip">here</a>.

							You can see the solutions for the <a href="job_shop_solution.py">job shop</a> and the <a
								href="seating_arrangement_solution.py">seating arrangment</a> problems. Those are
							slightly
							different than the ones presented, but you should be able to understand why these
							diffferences
							do not change the solution.
