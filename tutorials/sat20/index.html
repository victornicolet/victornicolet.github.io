							This short tutorial serves as an introduction to using Z3 through its Python interface as
							well as learning how to encode general problems into SAT problems. The first step, if you
							haven't done so before, is to install Z3 and its python bindings. Once your installation is
							working, you can start going through the video tutorial.<br>
							The first video introduces basics commands and then explains how the Five Queens problem can
							be encoded into a SAT problem. The second (bonus) video uses all the commands and techniques
							presented in the first video to write a Sudoku solver in a few lines.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can find a guide to the API <a
								href="https://ericpony.github.io/z3py-tutorial/guide-examples.htm"> here</a>. However,
							in this tutorial we are only using a very restricted subset of the commands. In particular
							we are not using integers or any other variable types than booleans. You might find reading
							this guide confusing at first, but rest assured, you will learn how to use other features of
							the solver during the next tutorial.

							In this tutorial, we will be using Z3's Python interface. The easiest way to install it,
							along with a Z3 binary, is to use Python's package manager <span
								class="codeSnippet">pip</span>. In this tutorial, we will be using Python 3.7. Start by
							installing the corresponding Z3 package with the command:
						</p>
						<div class="codeSnippet">pip install z3-solver</div>
						<p>
							<span class="alert">Remark that the corresponding package is <span
									class="codeSnippet">z3-solver</span> and not <span class="codeSnippet">z3</span>. Do
								not install the latter!</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							We will not need any other package in this tutorial, so you can create a virtual environment
							with this package only. You can also look for other installation methods on <a
								href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3" target="_blank">Z3' github page </a>, and keep in
							mind that we want to use the Python interface. Once you are set up, you should be able to
							call the solver from your terminal and see:
						</p>
						<p class="code">
							$ z3 </br>
							Error: input file was not specified. </br>
							For usage information: z3 -h
						</p>
						<p> To test your Python installation, launch the Python interpreter for which you installed Z3.
							You should be able to type the following commands:</p>
						<p class="code">
							$ python </br>
							... </br>
							>>> from z3 import *</br>
							>>> s = Solver()</br>
							>>> s.check()</br>
							sat
						</p>
						<p>
							Now you have installed all the software we need in this tutorial. If you want to do some
							background reading, you can start <a
								href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/wiki#background">here</a> but the tutorial will be
							self contained. Z3 is much more than a simple SAT solver, but we will not use any of its SMT
							solving or theorem proving capabilities for now.

						<p>
							In the first part of the video, we review the basic functionalities we need in order to
							write formulas and manipulate the solver.
						</p>
						<p>
							To write a boolean formula, we will need to declare boolean variables for the solver. You
							can do this in Python using the <span class="code">Bool()</span> constructor. For example,
							we can start by creating two boolean variables <span class="code">x</span> and <span
								class="code">y</span>:
						</p>
						<p class="code">
							>>> from z3 import *</br>
							>>> x = Bool("x")</br>
							>>> y = Bool("y")</br>
						</p>
						<p>
							With boolean variables, you can build boolean formulas. <span class="code">z3</span> gives
							you constructors for disjunctions and conjunctions, negation, and equivalence:
						</p>
						<p class="code">
							>>> x_or_y = Or([x,y]) # disjunction</br>
							>>> x_and_y = And([x,y]) # conjunction</br>
							>>> not_x = Not(x) # negation</br>
							>>> x_or_y_iff_not_x = x_and_y == not_x # This is the formula (x_or_y <=> not_x) not a
								boolean! </br>
						</p>
						<p>
							Once we have built the clauses that compose our problem, we can pass them to a solver:
						</p>
						<p class="code">
							>>> s = Solver() # create a solver s</br>
							>>> s.add(x_or_y) # add the clause: x or y</br>
							>>> z = Bool("z")</br>
							>>> s.add(Or[x,y,Not(z)]) # add another clause: x or y or !z
						</p>
						<p>
							Calling <span class="code">s.check()</span> at that point will ask the solver to find a
							satisfying assignment for the boolean formula built from the conjunction of all the clauses
							that have been added through <span class="code">s.add(..)</span>. In our running example,
							the call should return <span class="code">sat</span>:
						</p>
						<p class="code">
							>>> s.check()</br>
							sat
						</p>
						<p>
							If the solver cannot find a satisfying assignment, then it will return <span
								class="code">unsat</span>. In the case it returned <span class="code">sat</span>, you
							can obtain the assignment itself with the <span class="code">model()</span> method:
						</p>
						<p class="code">
							>>> s.model()</br>
							[x = False, y = True, z = False]
						</p>
						<p>
							And that is all you need for this tutorial, as well as for the assignment. The difficulty
							will be to design the encoding, not to use the solver!
