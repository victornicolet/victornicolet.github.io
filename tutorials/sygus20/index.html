                            This tutorial is a short introduction to using <a
                                href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/rosette-guide/index.html"> Rosette</a> for program
                            synthesis. You should start by following the <a
                                href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/rosette-guide/ch_getting-started.html"
                                target="_blank">Getting
                                Started</a> part of the guide. You will be required to <a
                                href="https://download.racket-lang.org" target="_blank">install Racket</a> (version >
                            7.0) and use the package manager of Racket to install Rosette. To interact with Rosette, we
                            will have to write Racket programs, which you might have learned to do in CSC324. But don't
                            worry if you haven't, our use of Racket will be limited and you only need to know how to
                            write simple functions and expressions.

                            This short video is meant to be an introduction to the syntax of the language used in the
                            tutorial. You do not need an advanced knowledge of Racket to understand the tutorial, only
                            an understanding of the syntax, and a basic understanding of what being a functional
                            language means. If you have taken CSC324 before, you can safely skip this.

                            Now we can focus on progam synthesis. In the video tutorial below, we intrdouce you to
                            <i>syntax-guided synthesis</i> using Rosette. In order to follow this tutorial, you need to
                            have Rosette installed. The editor used in the demo is Emacs, but feel free to use your
                            editor of choice. If you use DrRacket, you can directly run the examples from your editor.

                            <b>Note:</b> in the tutorial I used a version of Rosette installed before May 2020. In the
                            current version, the first example of the tutorial does not seem to work. You can get around
                            that problem by replacing one of the (??) by a 3.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Rosette has an excellent documentation, <a
                                href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/rosette-guide/index.html" target="_blank">the Rosette
                                Guide</a>. We are interested in the <i>synthesis</i> part (Sections 2.3.3, 3.2.5 and
                            6.2.2) but
                            the section defining the built-in datatypes will also be useful to you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can also have a look at last year's tutorial <a
                                href="https://github.com/victornicolet/csc410-p4parser/blob/master/rosette-tutorial.rkt">on
                                Github</a>. However, be cautious with the example used here. Because of the use of
                            non-linear arithmetic, the synthesis times can increase dramatically for seemingly innocuous
                            changes in the expression grammar.
